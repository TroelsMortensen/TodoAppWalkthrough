# TodoAppWalkthrough

A simple todo app, which follows our MVVM JavaFX architecture.

I'm doing a video tutorial. YouTube link to be attached later.

This time I've tried to use different branches, so you can see for each video part what the code looks like. 
This is because I imagine I'll make code cleanups/refactorings along the way.
